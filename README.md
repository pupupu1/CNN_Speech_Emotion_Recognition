# CNN_Speech_Emotion_Recognition

This project is based on the Keras framework and experiments with neural networks combined with attention mechanisms to recognize emotions in speech. It consists of five parts:

1. Class Balance: Data augmentation techniques. Run preprocessing.py to generate.
2. Feature Extraction: Run preprocessing.py. Features are extracted using the librosa package.
3. Model Training: Run model.py. The training process is displayed in the control window.
4. Performance Evaluation: Run model.py. The program calculates and evaluates metrics.
5. Attention Weight Visualization: Run model.py to generate images.
